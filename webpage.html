    <h1>C Language Introduction</h1>
    <p>C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell
        Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating
        system.</p>
    <h2 class="grey">The main features of the C language include:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>General Purpose and Portable</li>
        <li>Low-level Memory Access</li>
        <li>Fast Speed</li>
        <li>Clean Syntax</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features make the C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler
        development.</p>
    <h2 class="grey">Why Should We Learn C ?</h2>
    <p>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of
        Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of
        C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).</p>
    <p>So, if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well. As
        learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system. Like pointers,
        working with memory locations, etc.</p>
    <h2>Components of a C Program:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Header Files Inclusion – Line 1 [#include <stdio.h>]</li>
        <br>
        <div>
            The first and foremost component is the inclusion of the Header files in a C program. A header file is a
            file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between
            several source files. All lines that start with # are processed by a preprocessor which is a program invoked
            by the compiler. In the above example, the preprocessor copies the preprocessed code of stdio.h to our file.
            The .h files are called header files in C.
            Some of the C Header files:
            <ul type="bullet">
                <li>stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.</li>
                <li>stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.</li>
                <li>stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions</li>
                <li>stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random network generator, and memory
                    allocation
                <li>string.h – Defines string handling functions</li>
                <li>math.h – Defines common mathematical functions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div><br>
        <li>Main Method Declaration – Line 2 [int main()]</li>
        <div>
           <p> The next part of a C program is to declare the main() function. It is the entry point of a C program and the
            execution typically begins with the first line of the main(). The empty brackets indicate that the main
            doesn’t take any parameter (See this for more details). The int that was written before the main indicates
            the return type of main(). The value returned by the main indicates the status of program termination. See
            this post for more details on the return type.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Body of Main Method – Line 3 to Line 6 [enclosed in {}]</li>
        <div>
           <p> The body of a function in the C program refers to statements that are a part of that function. It can be
            anything like manipulations, searching, sorting, printing, etc. A pair of curly brackets define the body of
            a function. All functions must start and end with curly brackets.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Statement – Line 4 [printf(“Hello World”);]</li>
        <div>
            <p>Statements are the instructions given to the compiler. In C, a statement is always terminated by a semicolon (;). In this particular case, we use printf() function to instruct the compiler to display “Hello World” text on the screen.</p>
